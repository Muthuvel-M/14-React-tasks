Below is a list of 14 React tasks with definitions and demo links for a GitHub README file:

# React Tasks

### 1. **Basic Component Creation**
Creating a functional or class component is fundamental in React. Components are reusable UI building blocks that accept inputs (props) and return React elements.

---

### 2. **State Management**
State management in React refers to the ability to track and update the state within a component using the `useState` hook or class-based `state`. This helps in dynamic content rendering.

**Demo**: [State Management](https://resilient-croissant-1789c4.netlify.app/)

---

### 3. **Conditional Rendering**
Conditional rendering allows components to render different UI elements based on certain conditions. This can be achieved using JavaScript's conditional operators within the JSX.

**Demo**: [Conditional Rendering](https://cr-app.netlify.app/)

---

### 4. **Forms and Controlled Components**
Controlled components are form elements whose values are controlled by React state. It allows you to manage user input and validate form submissions.

**Demo**: [Controlled Components](https://keen-sunshine-762e6f.netlify.app/)

---

### 5. **Component Composition**
Component composition is the practice of nesting components within other components to create more complex UIs. This promotes code reuse and modularity.

---

### 6. **Lifecycle Methods or useEffect Hook**
In React functional components, the `useEffect` hook is used to handle side effects (e.g., fetching data, manual DOM manipulations). It can mimic class-based lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.

**Demo**: [useEffect Hook](https://regal-crostata-9bf6e6.netlify.app/)

---

### 7. **Routing with React Router**
React Router is a library that enables navigation between different components in a React app. It provides routing features such as `<Route>`, `<Switch>`, and `<Link>`.

**Demo**: [React Router Example](https://genuine-dodol-05047a.netlify.app/)

---

### 8. **State Lift-Up and Props Drilling**
When components need to share the same state, you can lift the state up to their closest common ancestor and pass the data down via props, a process called "props drilling."

**Demo**: [State Lift-Up](https://stunning-faun-9cad5a.netlify.app/)

---

### 9. **Context API or Redux Integration**
The Context API and Redux are tools for managing state across multiple components without manually passing props through each level. Redux is often used for more complex global state management.

**Demo**:[Redux Integration Example](https://delightful-bublanina-6884e4.netlify.app/)

---

### 10. **Advanced UI and Performance Optimization**
Performance optimization techniques in React include memoization using `React.memo`, lazy loading, and preventing unnecessary re-renders with `useCallback` and `useMemo`.

**Demo**: 

---

### 11. **Error Boundary Implementation**
Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in the component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI.

**Demo**: [Error Boundaries](https://spiffy-biscuit-80f06d.netlify.app/)

---

### 12. **Authentication and Protected Routes**
Authentication can be implemented with protected routes, which only render specific components if the user is authenticated. This is often done with React Router and state management.

**Demo**: 

---

### 13. **Optimistic UI Updates**
Optimistic UI updates instantly reflect a change in the UI without waiting for a server response. This enhances user experience by making the app feel more responsive.

**Demo**: [Optimistic UI Updates](https://statuesque-manatee-7c4af9.netlify.app/)

---

### 14. **Code Splitting and Lazy Loading**
Code splitting allows you to load parts of the application lazily using `React.lazy` and `Suspense`. It reduces the bundle size by only loading what is needed.

**Demo**: [Code Splitting](https://splendorous-malasada-139e58.netlify.app/)
